Based on the above data, launching a Kickstarter to fund a play has a very high liklihood of success, especially when started in May.

## Other Kickstarter Success Factors

From an analysis of goals and pledges from both successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns, the following trends emerged. 
Successful campaigns, in general, asked for lower, more reasonable amounts as a goal. 
* The median goal for all successful campaigns was $3,000, where as the median for all failed campaigns was $5,000. 
Though not a substantial difference when looking at the goals alone, the median pledge amounts deviated drastically based on the campaign's goal. 
* The median amount pledged for successful campaigns was $3,168 or 106% of the goal. The median amount pledged for failed campaigns, however, was $103 or 2% of goal.

## Recommendations

Based on the data above, it is highly recommended to have a goal under $5,000. Based on your stated goal of $10,000, you would need to lower your goal to have a good chance of securing funding. Additionally, the time of year greatly impacts success rates, so starting a campaign in May provides you the best opportunity to secure the needed funding, but anytime in late Spring or early Summer still has a high success rate. Overall, plays are frequently funded on Kickstarter, but limiting your goal to $5,000 and starting the campaign in May create your best chance for success.
