# Kickstarter Outcomes by Launch Date and Funding Goal

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of theater Kickstarter campaigns by launch date and by funding goal.

## Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
The Kickstarter data was filtered for all theater campaigns and organized by the month the campaign was launched. Each month's launches were then categorized into Successful, Failed, and Canceled outcomes. The results are visualized below:
